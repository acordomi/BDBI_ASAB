  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Given two sequences seq1 and seq2, count the number of positions in which seq1 and seq2 contain the
    same residue (as if it was a sequence alignment). Display both sequences with an additional line containing * when there is a match.
     Assume seq1 and seq2 have the same length.

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <pre><b>Ex1:</b>
With sequences defined as the following variables:
seq1 = "AAAAAAAA"
seq2 = "AGCTATAA"

The output should be:
AAAAAAAA
AGCTATAA
*   * ** 
found 4 matches as indicated by *

<b>Ex2:</b> 
With sequences defined as the following variables:
seq1 = "AAAAAAAA"
seq2 = "TTTTTTTT"
